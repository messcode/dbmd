# Distributed Bayesian Matrix Decomposition

## Introduction

This code is for "Distributed Bayesian Matrix Decomposition for Big Data Mining and Clustering".

![Illustration of updating **W**. AGD optimizes **W** on the central processor.
      ADMM and CEASE update $\boldsymbol{W}_c$ on the node machines and aggregate them on the central processor.
      The steps at each round of iteration are numbered sequentially.](./output/digrams.png)
